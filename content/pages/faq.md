## WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF PRODUCT MINDSET?

Companies who have the product mindset:
• Grow faster and more profitably
• Grow market share and increase customer engagement
• Build features customers want
• Operate with efficiency, focus and speed
• Continuously adapt and improve

## WHAT IS 3PILLAR GLOBAL?
We are a product lifecycle management and development company that accelerates business growth. We believe in engineering software products that have a true purpose. And we know that you need a partner that doesn't just plan, but one who can get it done. At 3Pillar, we think big, we solve small.

We serve clients with product strategy, product management, product engineering, product architecture, user experience and design, QA automation, DevOps and Cloud Ops.

## WHERE DID THE PRODUCT MINDSET COME FROM?
“Product Mindset” was coined by our founder David DeWolf in 2009. David built the company around product development gone wrong and found the single biggest reason for failure was not skills or process but that team members didn’t have a business context for what they were trying to do.

We train every new employee of 3Pillar about the Product Mindset and have a global team of champions who run training and events around the world for our staff. They also contribute to all the content you see from us. Everything we teach is something we use in a variety of environments.

## WHO TEACHES THESE WORKSHOPS?
Members of 3Pillar’s executive team and the Product Strategy & Design team teach the workshops. Each one has many years of experience in product development working with different teams with different challenges. Contact us  here.
